## Lecture

### Week-02 Feedback Review
#### pros
- shout-outs to instructional staff
- collaborating for the win!
- getting help  
- general support & enthusiasm

#### cons
- This week was tough in many ways, the mental fatigue really set in.
  - how to minimize the impact
- classes with  our code reveiw or exercise turn into long days
  - I felt this also...  we'll break it up!

#### Week-02 in a nut shell...
- It was a really challenging week, I had ups and downs and struggled a lot. As the week got further on though I started to feel better and realized that I think I know more than I thought I did
- I felt very confident following week 1, then I hit a wall called "Salmon Cookies" ...  ...I began reading the requirements for lab's carefully and realized it was a lot less work than I thought, I adhered to the 15 minute rule, and got help anytime I was stuck.  My week started going really well after that, it is still hard and a lot of work but much more manageable and the program feels a lot more doable.
- I love the ramping up that happened this week. Lots of new material and definitely some frustrating moments. A good balance of things. Definitely a lot still to cover!

### Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 11 of Code 201, students will be able to:

- Display some number of randomly selected images in a web document, and track clicks on those images, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Use principles of Object-Oriented Programming to manage their vote tracker project, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
- Retrieve data from an array of image objects and display that data as a list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment.
